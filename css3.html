      Today W3C released to the public the April 2021 edition of our W3C Strategic Highlights which documents the tremendous work to enhance, grow and strengthen the Web platform, and how the Web Consortium meets the needs of industry and society as
      a whole. At the same time, as we celebrate the anniversary of the release of the World Wide Web into the public domain on 30 April 1993 by CERN, our CEO Jeff Jaffe has published his reflections on the centrality of the Web Consortium as the Web
      has been accelerating to meet society’s needs, and on the importance of the Web infrastructure in the modern world. Human civilization is at an extraordinary juncture. The Web Consortium is in an incredible position to host the open forum where
      diverse voices from different parts of the world come together to incubate and build the global standards for the Web in the 25 years to come.The division of Europe into a number of independent states, connected, however, with each other, by
      the general resemblance of religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern tyrant, who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his people, would soon
      experience a gentle restraint from the example of his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies, and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure, escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would
      easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaints, and perhaps the means of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the world, and when that empire fell into the hands of a
      single person, the world became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. The slave of Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life or exile on the barren rock of Seriphus,
      or the frozen banks of the Danube, expected his fate in silent despair. To resist was fatal, and it was impossible to fly. This article looks at ways of handling text direction for structural markup in HTML, ie. at the document level and for
      elements like paragraphs, tables and forms. The article has been largely rewritten to take into account recent developments in HTML and CSS. A section was added to describe the use of logical properties. The text was make more concise.
      Sometimes people wonder whether it’s possible to obtain a definitive list of language tags which indicate a RTL base direction, so that there would be no need for separate direction metadata. This article looks into whether that is really
      feasible. (Spoiler: The W3C Internationalization Working Group believes it is not.) Sometimes people wonder whether it’s possible to obtain a definitive list of language tags which indicate a RTL base direction, so that there would be no need
      for separate direction metadata. This article looks into whether that is really feasible. (Spoiler: The W3C Internationalization Working Group believes it is not a feasible approach.) The worked examples and the descriptions of markup have been
      moved to a new page: Inline bidi markup examples. This and various small edits, including a new set of examples with links to live versions, are intended to make it easier to read the main article and make its advice clearer. The W3C
      Internationalization (I18n) Activity works with W3C working groups and liaises with other organizations to make it possible to use Web technologies with different languages, scripts, and cultures. From this page you can find articles and other
      resources about Web internationalization, and information about the groups that make up the Activity. Read also about the opportunities to participate and fund work via the new Sponsorship Program.
